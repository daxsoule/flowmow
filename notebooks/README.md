# notebooks

These are the FlowMow2 notebooks, which are the primary processing documents for
this project.

 - **read_raw.ipynb**: This notebook reads the raw data directly from DAT files, or in the case of the Sentry nav, Matlab files, stored on Google Drive into Pandas dataframes, and stores these dataframes in the /data/interim directory with a "\_raw" extension. Running through this notebook is required to create the interim data files for all subesquent processing. The MD5 hashes in /data/interim should match those the output files of this notebook.

 - **convert_raw.ipynb**: This is where the raw data are converted into real units (e.g. pressure), and the Sentry nav is projected into the UTM-9 coordinate system. Output files from this notebook are also stored in /data/interim with a "\_converted" extension. This notebook is a work in progress so the files generated by this script may change.

 - **origami_transform.ipynb**: This is where a position vector for the Nortek data is estimated using the "origami" transform, which is a geometrical transform based on Sentry nav pitch/heading/roll, and timestamp interpolation. Output from this notebook is "nortek\_origami.h5" file stored in /data/interim.
