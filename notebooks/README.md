# FlowMow2:notebooks

These are the FlowMow2 notebooks, which are the primary processing documents for
this project.

 - **read_raw.ipynb**: This notebook reads the raw data directly from DAT files stored on Google Drive into a Pandas dataframe, and stores this dataframe in the /data/interim directory. Running through this notebook is required to create the interim data files for all subesquent processing. The MD5 hashes in /data/interim should match those the output files of this notebook.

 - **convert_raw.ipynb**: This is where the raw dataframe data are converted into real units (e.g. pressure), and alternative coordinate systems are created. Output files from this notebook are also stored in /data/interim. This is a work in progress so the files generated by this script will likely change.
