# notebooks

These are the FlowMow2 notebooks which form the primary data processing pipeline for this project.

 - **read_raw.ipynb**: In this notebook raw data are read directly from original DAT files, or in the case of the Sentry nav, Matlab files, stored on Google Drive into Pandas dataframes. Outputs from this notebook are stored in the /data/interim directory with a "\_raw" extension. Running through this notebook is required to create the interim data files for all subesquent processing. The MD5 hashes in /data/interim should match those of the output from this notebook.

 - **convert_raw.ipynb**: In this notebook the raw data are converted into real units (e.g. pressure), and the Sentry nav is projected into the UTM-9 coordinate system. Outputs from this notebook are stored in /data/interim directory with a "\_converted" extension. This notebook is a work in progress so the files generated by this script may change.

 - **scratch.ipynb**: This notebook contains various snippets of code serving as examples or which may come in handy elsewhere.
